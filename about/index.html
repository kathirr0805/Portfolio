        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <p>
            My projects showcase my expertise in VLSI and embedded systems. I designed a <strong>16-bit Single Cycle MIPS Processor</strong> in Verilog (100 MHz, 98% coverage, 10% power reduction) using Vivado and ModelSim. My <strong>RISC-V Implementation</strong> features a 32-bit RV32I processor with a 5-stage pipeline (98% coverage, 15% reduced delay). I developed an <strong>Early-Stage PPA Prediction</strong> system using Python and scikit-learn (85–92% accuracy) with a Flask interface. The <strong>Smart Parking System in Verilog</strong> uses state machines for sensor-based control, and the <strong>3-bit Flash ADC in Verilog</strong> achieves high-speed conversion. For embedded systems, I built a <strong>Face Recognition Smart Lock System</strong> using OpenCV on Raspberry Pi (80% confidence) and a <strong>Vehicle Number Plate Detection</strong> system with ESP32 and MQTT (85% OCR accuracy), validated via Wokwi.
